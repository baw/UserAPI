# User Api

## Technologies

I used Rails for this API since its conventions proved a good foundation to
rapidly build out a demo API.

## Versioning

API versioning is implemented through adding the version to the url since I feel
this is a simpler design to both implement and to use the api then using a
customer request header or the accept header.
